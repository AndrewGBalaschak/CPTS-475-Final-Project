# CPTS-475-Final-Project
This project aims to use a neural network to increase the dataset density of minority classes

## Dataset
We are using the NF-UQ-NIDS dataset, which can be downloaded at https://staff.itee.uq.edu.au/marius/NIDS_datasets/
Extract the files and place every file in a directory named "data" in the repo, without any subfolders.
